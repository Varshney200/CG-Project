# Computer Graphics -Project (5th Sem)

## About the Project
In this project, we have made a web application wherein we have used a cube to depict rotation about x, y, z-axis, and composite rotations about xy, yz, zx, and xyz axis. We have used orthographic projection to represent a three-dimensional object in two dimensions. We have designed a responsive website using HTML to create the basic layout and JavaScript to depict animations.
